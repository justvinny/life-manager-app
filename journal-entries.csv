Random Entry #4-||==||-14-10-2020-||==||-In short, the process is equivalent to what is done on a crime scene: Don’t touch anything (if possible), gather evidence, take pictures, make movies, get data from all possible sources, find witnesses.==newline====newline==Collecting and confronting data is an important part of the process. If a sensor is defective, you might not be able to exploit a specific parameter. You then will have to derive the missing data from another source. The hardest investigation on a Boeing 777 I recall was in London, UK; both engines stopped working very close to the runway during landing. The airplane crash-landed. The problem was found after numerous simulations and efforts. The culprit was ice forming in the fuel filters, creating reduced fuel flow to the engines when they needed high fuel flow. The ice melted after the crash leaving almost no evidence in the fuel system. ==newline====newline==When an investigation comes to an end, recommendations and sometimes changes in the regulation are introduced. One of the most recent rules introduced was due to the Germanwings crash: The flight deck must be occupied by two persons at all times. If one pilot gets out of the cockpit then another crew member has to come in. (Ref: 4U 9525).==newline====newline==A final investigation report example from Transport Canada can be found in the link below: An Air France A340 during landing overshoot the end of the runway, went into a ditch, and caught fire. Everybody survived. Transport Canada report, AF 358.==newline====newline==The recommendation from Transport Canada was: ==newline====newline==    The Department of Transport requires that passenger safety briefings include clear direction to leave all carry-on baggage behind during an evacuation.==newline====newline==Unfortunately, the same problem occurred killing 41 passengers because people took their carry on luggage with them during the evacuation. (Ref SU 1492) ==newline====newline==I have published an article (in French) about safety onboard. If you aren’t fluent in French at least the videos should give you an idea of why we are asking passengers to remain seated and strapped until we shut down the engines, keep your seatbelt on at all times, and so on. (Ref Folding your tray, window shades up: Why so important?)==newline====newline==What we can learn is that applying a fix to a Process might not be sufficient. You might also need to work on “People” and/or the “Product.” (As a reader, you could contribute and enhance the safety record by spreading the word about emergency evacuation briefings during take-offs and landings.)
Random Entry #2-||==||-14-10-2020-||==||-Key Takeaways==newline====newline==    Java SE 13 (Sept 2019) introduced text blocks as a preview feature, aimed at reducing the pain of declaring and using multi-line string literals in Java. It was subsequently refined in a second preview, with minor changes, and is scheduled to become a permanent feature of the Java Language in Java SE 15(Sept 2020).==newline==    String literals in Java programs are not limited to short strings like "yes" and "no"; they often correspond to entire "programs" in structured languages such as HTML, SQL, XML, JSON, or even Java. ==newline==    Text blocks are string literals that can comprise multiple lines of text and uses triple quotes (""") as its opening and closing delimiter.==newline====newline==    A text block can be thought of as a two dimensional block of text embedded in a Java program.==newline==    Being able to preserve the two-dimensional structure of that embedded program, without having to muck it up with escape characters and other linguistic intrusions, is less error-prone and results in more readable programs.==newline====newline==Preview Features==newline====newline==Given the global reach and high compatibility commitments of the Java platform, the cost of a design mistake in a language feature is very high. In the context of a language misfeature, the commitment to compatibility not only means it is very difficult to remove or significantly change the feature, but existing features also constrain what future features can do -- today's shiny new features are tomorrow's compatibility constraints.==newline====newline==The ultimate proving ground for language features is actual use; feedback from developers who have actually tried them out on real codebases is essential to ensure that the feature is working as intended. When Java had multi-year release cycles, there was plenty of time for experimentation and feedback. To ensure adequate time for experimentation and feedback under the newer rapid release cadence, new language features will go through one or more rounds of preview, where they are part of the platform, but must be separately opted into, and which are not yet permanent -- so that in the event they need to be adjusted based on feedback from developers, this is possible without breaking mission-critical code.
Random Entry #1-||==||-14-10-2020-||==||-Garbage collection is a system "house-keeping" activity, separate from the main processing of the application, that seeks to determine memory that is no longer in use and automatically recover it for reuse.==newline====newline==Dijkstra’s definition makes it clear that while reference counting is a form of automatic memory management, it is not a form of garbage collection.==newline====newline==Reference counting works by updating per-object metadata as the program runs (e.g. when setting a field of reference type to a new value). The work needed to update the metadata takes place on the application thread and so cannot be cleanly divided into a separate activity.
Random Entry # 3-||==||-14-10-2020-||==||-It has also earned him a finalist position in the New Zealand Geographic Photographer of the Year competition.==newline====newline==The Niwa competition was judged by Stuff visual journalist Ross Giblin and Gerry le Roux from Science Lens.==newline====newline==Giblin, who has judged the competition for years and been a photographer all of his life, said Middleton’s photo ticked all the boxes for the category. “This photo has it all, a great shot with humour, uniqueness and brilliantly done.”==newline====newline==Choosing a winning shot is never easy, especially when all the entrants are of such a high calibre.==newline====newline==“They’re always a pleasure to judge because the stuff is so good and [are of] things you’ve never seen before in your life.==newline====newline==“When you get some that have similarities ... it makes it a bit tricky [to choose].”==newline====newline==Middleton got his first underwater camera about 15 years ago and hasn’t stopped searching for exciting and interesting things since. He’s passionate about marine reserves and believes there should be more protected areas like the Poor Knights.==newline====newline==“They’re lots of unknowns out there if you look hard enough you can usually find something rare and unusual in the marine environment.==newline====newline==“I’m definitely a bit of a geek when it comes to these kinds of things. I get very excited.”==newline====newline==Other finalists in this year’s competition included reflections on Lake Matheson by Dafei Wu, and a shot of Mt Taranaki by Shannon Crow.==newline====newline==Niwa Marine ecology technician Richie Hughes was awarded the People’s Choice Award for his image of a cave within the Poor Knights Marine Reserve.
